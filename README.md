# CS480-FinalProject
## Overview:
In our project we aim to develop a web app that connects with mySQL so that users can register for various events.  It will allow users to sign up for events, manage their registrations and overall make registering for events an easy, simple process.

Please note this is just our initial project overview and is subject to change!
